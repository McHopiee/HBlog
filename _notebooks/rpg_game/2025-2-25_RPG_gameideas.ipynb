    "So, the main character wakes up in a basement and has some sort of memory loss. Due to their lack of food and water for the past few days, they start to hallucinate anime girls around the basement because the main character is just that much of a degenerate. There are two or three girls around the level that the main character can interact with, but none of them actually tell him how to get out of the basement because they are nothing but hallucinations.\n",

    "### base game \n",
    "Either way, the anime girls quiz him on his knowledge. One girl will be asking him questions about JavaScript, one will ask him math questions, and the other will be asking questions that are almost impossible to understand. In order to move onto the next game, the main character has to correctly answer all of the last girl's questions. Only then will he finally snap out of his degenerate state."
